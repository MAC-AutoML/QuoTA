## QuoTA: Query-oriented Token Assignment via CoT Query Decouple for Long Video Comprehension

## ðŸ˜® Highlights


![introductionv2_01](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f568fcc0-bf46-41d0-a0cf-bd30745069ab)


- **We design a versatile plug-and-play pipeline for existing LVLMs:** QuoTA provides a training-free solution applicable to diverse LVLMs, enhancing long video understanding performance by assigning visual tokens based on text instruction (query) relevance. This approach offers a more elegant and direct methodology compared to conventional attention-based analytical techniques.
- **We propose CoT-driven query decouple for query-oriented frame scoring:** QuoTA employs Chain-of-Thoughts to decouple query into a specific-designed question, enabling high-quality scoring of video frames.
- **Our QuoTA setting a new state-of-the-art:** Integration of QuoTA with LLaVA-Video-7B yields a 3.2% average performance improvement across six benchmarks, achieving the best results in five video benchmarks, including Video-MME and MLVU, among 7B LVLMs.

## ðŸ”¨ Usage

This repo is built upon LLaVA-NeXT:

- Step 1: Clone and build LLaVA-NeXT conda environment, then install the following packages in llava envs:

```
git clone https://github.com/LLaVA-VL/LLaVA-NeXT
conda create -n llava python=3.10 -y
conda activate llava
pip install --upgrade pip  # Enable PEP 660 support.
pip install -e ".[train]"
```

- Step 2: Replace the file under `LLaVA-NeXT/llava/model/llava_arch.py` with `core/llava_arch.py`: 

- Step 3: Move all our code under LLaVA-NeXT (`tools/` and `quota_pipeline.py`)

- Step 4: You can now run our pipeline build upon LLaVA-Video-7B by:

```
python quota_pipeline.py
```

- Note that you can also use our pipeline for other LVLMs.
